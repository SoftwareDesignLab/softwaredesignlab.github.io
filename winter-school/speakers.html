                Yuanfang Cai is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Drexel University. Dr Cai's broad research area is software engineering; specific interests include formal software design modeling and analysis, software economics, software evolution and modularity. The questions that motivated her research include: how to design software that enable hundreds of developers to work collaboratively, concurrently, and independently from each other? how to make sure that modules in a software system can evolve independently? Does it worthwhile to refactor? How to detect software quality problems that incur tremendous maintenance cost but are not detectible using traditional V&V methods, such as extra dependencies and technical debts?

                Yuanfang Cai received her Ph.D. and M.S degrees in Computer Science from the University of Virginia in 2006 and 2002 respectively, advised by Professor Kevin Sullivan. Yuanfang Cai received her B.S. in Computer Science from Xidian University in 1996, advised by Professor Gong. Before coming to the US in 2000, Yuanfang Cai worked for North China Institute of Computing Technology, one of the top computer research institutions in China.

                Lu Xiao is an assistant professor at the School of Systems and Enterprises at the Stevens Institute of Technology. Her broad research interests lie in the area of Software Engineering. Lu Xiao's research centers around modeling and analyzing software architecture for addressing separate concerns of different stakeholders. One of her on-going projects is analyzing how a software system's architecture impacts the communication among developers and vice versa. Lu Xiao is also working on constructing a test-aware architecture model to support testing-related decision making in software projects.

                Rick Kazman is a Professor at the University of Hawaii and a Visiting Scientist (and former Senior Member of the Technical Staff) at the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. His primary research interests are software architecture, design and analysis tools, software visualization, and software engineering economics. He also has interests in human-computer interaction and information retrieval. Kazman has created several highly influential methods and tools for architecture analysis, including the SAAM (Software Architecture Analysis Method), the ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) and the Dali architecture reverse engineering tool. He is the author of over 100 papers, and co-author of several books, including Software Architecture in Practice, and Evaluating Software Architectures: Methods and Case Studies.

Kazman received a B.A. (English/Music) and M.Math (Computer Science) from the University of Waterloo, an M.A. (English) from York University, and a Ph.D. (Computational Linguistics) from Carnegie Mellon University. How he ever became a software engineering researcher is anybody's guess. When not architecting or writing about architecture, Kazman may be found cycling, playing the piano, gardening, practicing Tae Kwon Do, or (more often) flying back and forth between Hawaii and Pittsburgh.
